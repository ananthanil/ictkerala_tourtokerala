                                            Ernakulam District came into being in 1958 April 1 by incorporating Kanayannoor, Kochi, Kunnathunadu, Aluva and Paroor Taluks. Deliberation for hours held at the Kerala Fine Arts Hall in 1957 and attended by a host of political, social and media activists was instrumental in the formation of the District.

                                            The etymology of the term ‘Ernakulam’ is linked to different sources, either temple-oriented or mythological. KomattilAchutha Menon attributes the origin of the word from a type of mud called ‘Erangiyal’. Lord Siva was addressed in Chennai as ‘Erayanar’in the past. In Kerala too, this was followed and it later came to be known as ‘Ernakulam’. Ebanubathootha who travelled along the Kerala coast between AD 1342 and AD 1347 did not even make a casual reference to Kochi. The name ‘Kochi’ is a combination of two terms, Koch&Azhi (small river-mouth).
                                            
                                            In 1405 AD, the provincial king of Perumbadappu switched its capital from Mahodayapuram to Kochi and came to be recognized as the King of Kochi paving way to the unprecedented glory of the kingdom. The traders from Portugal who had landed in Kochi by then took advantage of the feud between the king of Kochi and the Zamorin of Kozhikode. The king provided the Portughese traders all the facilities including the permission to open a warehouse. Trade flourished in Kochi. Soon there took place a battle between the Zamorin and the king of Kochi. Although the king of Kochi was defeated initially he regained his kingdom with the timely assistance of the warship from Portugal. Eventually the relation between the king of Kochi and the Portughese traders became strained and with the support of the Dutch, the king succeeded in driving out the Portughese from Kochi in 1663.
                                            
                                            Of all the kings who ruled Kochi, SakthanThampuran (1790-1805) was the mightiest and during his time the kingdom expanded. Paliathachans who belong to the Chennamangalam village were the Chief Ministers of the kings of Kochi for almost one hundred and fifty years. By 1800, the British took over the administration of Kochi and thenceforth the kings paid tributes to the British in recognition of the latter’s supremacy.

                              <p>One of the first bird sanctuaries in Kerala and undeniably a haven for nature enthusiasts. In the words of Salim Ali (world famous ornithologist), Thattekkad is the “richest bird sanctuary in India” since it is home to hundreds of different endangered species of migratory birds. This thick deciduous forest has plantations of mahogany, teak, rosewood and rubber running through it. Make sure to bring along a pair of binoculars to get a glimpse of the birdlife. The best time to visit would be between November and March</p>

                              <p>Boasting the quintessential architectural style of Kerala, Krishnapuram Palace is a gorgeous 18th-century affair. Dormer windows, a gabled roof and narrow corridors lend it uniqueness. Once the property of Maharaja Marthanda Varma of Travancore, this palace (also includes a museum) is currently under the Kerala State Department of Archaeology’s care. Soak in the serenity of the large pond inside the palace, which is believed to conceal underground escape paths from enemies. Spare some time to admire a Bible written in Sanskrit, a double-edged sword called Kayamkulam Val, and the stunning 154 sq. ft. Gajendra Moksham mural.</p>

                            <p> A stroll through the lanes of Fort Kochi will definitely attract you to the rustic and old-fashioned neighbourhood of Mattancherry. It is said that back in the days, this cheri (street), was lined with mutton butchers, and so it ended up being called “Muttoncherry” which over the years evolved into “Mattancherry”. Today the place exhibits centuries-old architectures and various social and cultural imprints left behind by foreigners. Declared as a heritage site by the government, Mattancherry has been an inspiration to historians, film-makers, travellers and artistes alike. Amongst all the Ernakulam tourist places, this museum is one of the most prominent attractions.</p>

Built by the Portuguese in regal style with Dutch and Portuguese influences, it is an architectural marvel.

                            Visitors remain awestruck at the sight of the gabled timber-framed roof, the confession box, baptism platform and the pulpit. It narrates many tales of the old world and their way of spiritual lives.</p>
